<p>So here we go. To start off, my full name is Efraim Jededia Z. Pangan. First two names were derived from the Bible.
 "Jedidiah" meaning 'beloved of God' and "Ephraim" meaning 'fruitful' referring to children. Yeah, the second name is
 better than the first. Anyways, I lived a typical child's life in my hometown Tarlac. Being the first born, my parents 
 were very excited to take me to various places.</p>

<p>I live in an average Filipino family. Not too shabby, not too extravagant. Feasts of foods scattered everywhere during occassions. Nothing out
of the ordinary. I was exposed to two ethnic groups: Tagalog from my mother's side and Kapampangan from my father's.
Growing up, I had a hard time understanding my parents. Some traits of my father is contrasting to my mother's. But I didn't mind. I learned to 
be carefree at a young age. Maybe this is why they became strict with my actions.

<p>Elementary and pre-school wasn't that memorable for me. I was a competitor but not that I wanted it. I was often put
in front of performances not because of my two left feet but because I was always the first one to memorize the routines.
I didn't like being put first because I was pressured. At a young age, I was given heavy expectations.</p>

<p>Skipping over to junior high school, that's when I finally enjoyed my school life. I met people of all kind that gave me good
and bad memories to forever cherish.

<p>This was also the time when my parents no longer pressured me. I was able to compose myself and catch up with other pupils.
I was a dark horse. I even graduated as the Top 8 of our batch. Unexpected for one who got average grades in their elementary days.</p>

<p>Now, I am currently studying in Baguio City at the University of the Cordilleras. I have met a multitude of people here
which I am not familair of but I still loved being independent. I've finished my SHS here also ranking as the
Top 8 again among the 2,600+ students of the Grade 12. I am taking Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in the same university.
I am struggling on coping up with the changes in the curriculum but I will emerge strong from all of this. I have one goal: to give
my parents a piece of paper that they haven't earned in their former years: a diploma.
