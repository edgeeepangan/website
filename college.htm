	<h3><u>Officialy Done with SHS!</u></h3>
		<p><b>Last August 2-3, 2018, the first batch of senior high school graduates of the University of the Cordilleras launched off to their college lives.

		The ceremony was divided into two days inside the gymnasium, August 2 for TVL, GAS, and ABM students and August 3 for STEM and HUMSS students. The event started off with 
		a baccalaureate ceremony lead by the Top 3 students of each strand. Afterwards, the commencement exercises followed.

		I am proud to say that I finished senior high school splendidly. I graduated with high honors being the top 3 of my strand, STEM. Other than that,
		I also am the top 8 of out of 2,600+ grade 12 students. No wonder why my family cried when they saw me again after months of not going home to my province :").</b></p>

	<h3><u>Clash of Courses</u></h3>
		<p><b>The university annualy holds the sports events in the months of October to November. The event started off with a invocation led by the UC Chorale.
		Afterwards, the UC Dance Crew, UC Taekwondo & Wushu, and athletes showcased their moves in a grand intermission number.

		After the opening, the various competions were held. All courses and grade levels gave their all in the events. The events is yet to be concluded after
		the grand event, the search for the next Mr. and Ms. UC.</b></p>
		<br><br><br>
	<h3><u>Travelling through Sound</u></h3>
		<p><b>Ever since the Cor de Mayo performance of the University of the Cordilleras Chorale, I was driven to join them. And I took the chance in my first college
		 year. In my shock, I passed the auditions and am now an offical Bass 2 member of the UC Chorale.

		<br>
		Now, here I am. Performing at events inside and outside the campus. My first event was for the opening of the Intramurals but sadly no pictures were taken.
		Second was a guest performance for the concert of the UC Percussion and Orchestra. We sang "Jesus Bleibet Maine Freude" and "Kay Ganda ng Ating Musika"

		Another was for the invocation and national anthem of the teacher's seminar held at the Crown Legacy Hotel.

		The latest event was a big one. The 1st ever SK Summit was held last November 23, 2018 at the Benitez Hall inside Teacher's Camp, Baguio City. The chorale
		was invited to perform a doxology and sing the national anthem for the event. Food was then served after the performance as gratitude.
